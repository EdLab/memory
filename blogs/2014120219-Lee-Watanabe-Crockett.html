<b>EXCLUSIVE NEW LEARNING TIMES INTERVIEW</b><br>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> How did your educational trajectory and past professional experience shape your current work?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> It's been said that when you look backwards at your life, it was perfectly planned. Everything worked out exactly the way it was supposed to. School and university or similar experiences, I don't think they did much for my education, in fact I feel that school got in the way most of the time. I have always been a passionate and voracious learner. When excited by something new, I tend to focus on it until I have devoured everything about it. My appetite for learning has allowed me to learn many languages and to play a lot of musical instruments. However, it actually made school quite difficult for me. I learned very quickly, and never found a teacher that could feed me fast enough. There was one courageous teacher, who challenged me to learn whatever I wanted to in his classroom, and then got out of the way. As a result I ended up completing three years of physics study in one year, and learning everything I could about art, computers, printing, photography, programming, and building at the same time. He never provided me any answers when I would ask he would respond with "that's a great question, why are you asking me?"

<p>It was my love of mathematics and physics that led me to engineering at university, but after that, my love for art led me to opening what became a prestigious graphic design firm. Years in the graphic design business required a special set of skills: real-time problem solving, creativity, collaboration, and just-in-time learning of new technologies. When I started in design, computers were not involved in the process. As my business progressed, a high-profile client called me and asked if we could "build one of those website things" for her. Of course, I said yes. But, I had no idea what a website was! One week later I had researched everything I could get my hands on about the World Wide Web. This just-in-time learning is now our new normal. Students today have new technology and new information available every single day. When we look at the skills critical for success, they align beautifully with what I have had hands on experience with as an artist and entrepreneur over the last 20 years.</p>

<p>
<b>Question:</b> How do you hope your work will change the learning landscape?<br> 
<b>Answer:</b> I am fortunate to work with some exceptional people, and some courageous educators. I have the privilege of working in over a dozen countries, and although there are many things that are different, there are many things that are exactly the same no matter where I am in the world. There is still a focus on teacher centered learning, on what I referred to as educational bulimia (the consumption and regurgitation of the right answer) and a general lack of opportunity for self-expression and self-determination. 
<p>
What I have seen in my work is schools that transform to modern learning environments where students use higher-order thinking to create products and solutions to real world problems. What I see students do is awe-inspiring. Students are using solution fluency outside of the classroom to solve problems in their personal life, for conflict resolution, and to solve problems they see in the world. 
<p>
My hope is that my work continues to transform learning to self-determined and self-directed learning. With a focus on <i>headwear</i> and <i>heartware</i> not hardware. I hope that ultimately through the Global Digital Citizen Foundation, this work helps to transform how we live, work, and treat our fellow citizens on this planet.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What broad trends do you think will have the most impact on learning in the years ahead? <br>
<b>Answer:</b> Without a doubt, there is a shift to online learning and self-directed learning. Traditional education models are falling apart at the seams. We all see it happening. We see learning failing to happen. If traditional K to 12 schools do not understand that their students, and by their students I mean their clients, expect something different, they will cease to exist. There is no doubt that the internet will give us choice, and with choice it will create higher standards and a higher quality product. 
<p>
The second trend that I see happening is a shift to the individual. Craftsmanship and quality are making a comeback from an era of mass-production. We are starting to value individuals above products and services. And because of this, I expect to see education that fills not only physical happiness, but an element of spiritual happiness as well. And I'm not speaking about religion when I say this. I'm talking about the inherent desire children have to be helpful to others, to do good things, to make the world a better place. Empowering students with skills like solution fluency allows them to make their desire for happiness manifest in the world. When this happens we will see massive change take place. Students are expecting, and will be demanding opportunities to do meaningful things as opposed to just busywork. Our addiction to our devices is starting to develop into a desire to reconnect with each other in a more real way.
<p>
Lastly, the massive shift to a globalized workforce is putting increasing pressure on what happens in schools. Corporations are outsourcing and automating all routine cognitive work at an alarming rate. Workforces are assembled on a project-by-project basis behind the best and brightest for the most reasonable price. Websites like <a href="https://www.odesk.com/">oDesk.com</a>, <a href="https://www.freelancer.com/?t=b&utm_expid=294858-224.BnxXSGpPTBOAmY3vwRjmiA.2&utm_referrer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Furl%3Fq%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Ffreelancer.com%252F%26sa%3DD%26sntz%3D1%26usg%3DAFQjCNEsiowBrNJYJd2dH4WOaH6pNRIH2g">freelancer.com</a>, and <a href="http://99designs.com/">99designs.com</a> have set a standard where millions of self-employed individuals can work anywhere on the planet. This is the new way of doing business. There is no need to have the overhead of the past, with generalized employees with a general set of skills. Outsourcing is just how business is done today. In a wired world, it does not matter where the other end of the wire is, the third floor, or the third world. Because of this, we are seeing x-rays done in Chicago, and analyzed real time in Pakistan.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> What are you currently working on & what is your next big project?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> I am currently working on a book about Mindful Assessment. The focus on summative, and content-based assessment is one thing that must change in education. It is only in academia that anyone is concerned with what you know. In the real world, nobody cares what you know, but only what you can do with what you know. My hope is that this book will help to address the problems of assessment the way that <i>Literacy is Not Enough</i> has helped to shift pedagogy. 
<p>
The next big project has to do with the Global Digital Citizen Foundation. For years we have had a program that allows any school to access a digital citizenship agreement and process for use in their schools, but with the Foundation, we are able to do even more. Firstly, we are expanding this program dramatically to include an ongoing plan that holistically deals with global digital citizenship, by including the parents, and the teachers at the other two sides of the triangle. We find that it is the adults - parents and teachers, not just the children that truly need an understanding of digital citizenship. 
<p>
We are also developing a project portal, think of it as a fundraiser, or kick starter program for student’s ideas. As I mentioned before, as students use Solution Fluency they start to see things in the world that they want to do to make a difference. Our plan is to fund their ideas for altruistic service through this portal. It is just one more way to continue to make what we do in school relevant to them in their lives.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> Who are the most interesting people you are following on Twitter?<br>
<b>Answer:</b> I follow a diverse group of people all of whom I find interesting. Reading tweets from the <a href="https://twitter.com/DalaiLama">Dalai Lama</a> is always a pleasure.
